# Intro

We want to have a better indicator to understand the evolution of the online demand. We could display the average search volume and compare it to the average search volume of the last year.

# Level 3 - Calculate the average search volume

Let's calculate and display the average search volume of the selected category in the selected period and its variation regarding the same period one year ago.

To present the variation, we calculate the percent variation of the average year over year using the formula: $variation = \frac{V_{new} - V_{old}}{V_{old}}$

Then go to [next level](../level4) (optional)
