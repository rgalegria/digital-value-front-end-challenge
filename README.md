# Digital Value Frontend Challenge 

Welcome to the Digital Value Frontend Challenge! Thank for your interest in participating in our selection process.

## Goal

The objective is to implement a simple data visualization application that must display the evolution of the online demand for a given selection of keywords (ie. the search volume).

Each level of the challenge is based on top of the previous one, so you can leverage what you already did.

We don't expect you to be an expert designer, but we want to see if you're comfortable with web design principles to build a pleasant and performant user experience.

## Guidelines

- Clone the repo
- Implement each level in ascending order (last two levels are optional)
- Commit at the end of each level
- Provide instructions to run each level of the challenge
- Host the highest level achieved of the challenge

## Rules

- Angular is preferred but React or Vue.js is also accepted
- Use version control to deliver the test

## What will be evaluated?
