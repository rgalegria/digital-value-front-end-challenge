# Intro

Restrict the application access to authorized users

# Level 4 - Authentication (optional)

Implement a very simple login page with a fake authentication system. There is no need to send the authentication request to a backend, you can hard code the login/password.
However, even if the authentication is faked, we would like to see how the application communicates the authorization to the API to fetch the data.

We would like to see if you're aware of the best practice of designing a secured authentication system.

Then go to [next level](../level5) (optional)
