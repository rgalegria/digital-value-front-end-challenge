# Intro

We want to have a better understanding of the online demand and navigate inside the category tree to refine the data displayed.

# Level 2 - Filtering by category

Implement a way to navigate inside the categories of the online demand.

The API `GET /api/categories.json` returns the category tree and `GET /api/volumes/${id}.json` returns the sum of the search volume per month for the list of keywords of a given category.

Then go to [next level](../level3)
